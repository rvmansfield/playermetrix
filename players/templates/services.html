    <h2>Player Metrics Testing Events</h2> 

    <P>Our core offering is capturing player data through a series of tests using technology to get accurate measurements. Each player is measured on metrics including the 60 yard dash, IF/OF throwing velocity, hitting velocity, pitch velocity, height/weight and more. After data has been captured the information is sent to the player/coaches and posted online where it can be shared.
